# Simple Calculator made in WinForms (.NET Framework)

This project was originally an idea that came up in my brain when I'm messing around with C++ stuff (and I was bored).

It's just an ordinary calculator, but looks bland (as heck), and break most of the time. If you encounter any errors while messing with it, create an issue.

This sucks anyways. If you wanna use it for reference or whatever you want, just take it, I wouldn't mind that. No need to credit.

I'll try to make this as complete as possible. Current version is v0.5c.
